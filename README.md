        # Hashes of Hashes Lab

## Learning Goals

1. Recognize vocabulary term: "hash of hashes"
2. Recognize that "Hashes of Hashes" are trees
3. Create a `Hash` of `Hash`es
4. Read scalar data from a `Hash` of `Hash`es
5. Modify scalar data in a `Hash` of `Hash`es

## Introduction

Having worked with `Array`s of `Array`s and `Array`s of `Hash`es, you're going
to be pleasantly surprised that most of the syntax for `Hash`es of `Hash`es
(HoH) works like AoAs, but with `Hash` keys as the components of a coordinate.
Unlike an AoA where coordinates help you find a position in a grid, coordinates
in HoH can be stacked deeply so that you can tunnel deeply into a HoH.

### Key Image: Relationship Tree

To help you when reading the rest of this lesson, keep in mind that a HoH is
like a family tree. Every person in a family tree is a, well, person. Every
person in a family tree has two chromosomal parents. And those parents are both
person instances which means they, in turn have two chromosomal parents...and
on...and on....all the way back to the DAWN OF LIFE.

Thus, we can render any given individual like so:

```ruby
# Not valid code
{
  name: "",
  mother: # THE SAME TYPE OF THING - something with a name, mother, and father key,
  father: # THE SAME TYPE OF THING - something with a name, mother, and father key
}
```

Because of the potential to go infinitely deep, we'll keep our HoHs only one or
two generations wide. Programmers in social networking companies call things
like our person instances "nodes."

### From Hash to Array of Hashes

Recall that a `Hash` is like a table, but in code form. It is a way for your
program to store pairs of data as elements in a collection.

We call names in a `Hash` that we use to point to data, keys. By providing a `Hash`
name and a key, we can uniquely identify a value.

## Recognize Vocabulary Term: "Hash of Hashes"

HoH's property of being made up of nodes that have the same structure of each
other makes them very popular in programming interviews. Much of the vocabulary
used to talk of these "node collections" is described by a mathematical
discipline called "graph theory." We're not going to discuss that vocabulary in
this lesson. But if you hear "leaf," "node," or "edge," you're starting to
approach "graph theory."

In the age of social networking being able to build "graphs" of "nodes" has
become very important. We'll make a mini-social network in our example below.

## Create a HoH

Let's make a simple family tree:

```ruby

# Simple Hashes
mother_hash = {
  name: "Debbie Reynolds",
  mother: {},
  father: {}
}

father_hash = {
  name: "Eddie Fisher",
  mother: {},
  father: {}
}

# Princess Leia (among other roles)
child = {
  name: "Carrie Fisher",
  mother: mother_hash,
  father: father_hash
} # => {:name=>"Carrie Fisher", :mother=>{:name=>"Debbie Reynolds", :mother=>{}, :father=>{}}, :father=>{:name=>"Eddie Fisher", :mother=>{}, :father=>{}}}
```

If we don't need to use `mother_hash` or `father_hash`, then we don't need to
assign them before nesting them in `child`.  We can write a nested HoH using
literal formatting:

```ruby
# AoH in one go
child = {:name=>"Carrie Fisher", :mother=>{:name=>"Debbie Reynolds", :mother=>{}, :father=>{}}, :father=>{:name=>"Eddie Fisher", :mother=>{}, :father=>{}}}

# Same as above, but using whitespace to make it easier for humans to read

child = {
  :name=>"Carrie Fisher",
  :mother=>{
    :name=>"Debbie Reynolds",
    :mother=>{},
    :father=>{}
  },
  :father=>{
    :name=>"Eddie Fisher",
    :mother=>{},
    :father=>{}
  }
}

```

Since Ruby doesn't care about whitespace, we'd advise you to write a HoH with
lots of indentation.

Take a moment to reflect. Can you "see" the tree's nodes? Each entity ("Eddie
Fisher", "Debbie Reynolds" and "Carrie Fisher") are the same _thing_ (a person)
with another "generation" of `Hash` data accessible via standard _keys_. This
means that we can "tunnel" through the infinite regress of HoHs to get data.

We've kept the regress very shallow here (2 generations), but you can imagine a
longer family tree could be quite deep indeed!

## Read Scalar Data From a Nested Array

One of the defining features of HoHs is that we use stacked keys to get data
out of the complex tree.  To read an element from a HoH simply "stack" keys:

```ruby
child = {
  :name=>"Carrie Fisher",
  :mother=>{
    :name=>"Debbie Reynolds",
    :mother=>{
      :name=> "Maxene Reynolds"
    },
    :father=>{}
  },
  :father=>{
    :name=>"Eddie Fisher",
    :mother=>{},
    :father=>{}
  }
}

child[:name] #=> "Carrie Fisher"
child[:mother][:name] #=> "Debbie Reynolds"
child[:mother][:mother][:name] #=> "Maxene Reynolds"
```

Through this "stacking" across "generations" we can see that Carrie Fisher's
grandmother's name was "Maxene."

> **PRO TIP**: When building HoHs, it's wise to ensure you have all the data
> uniform. We should ensure that we have the mother / father data for "Eddie
> Fisher". To show "end of our knowledge" we've used an empty `Hash`.

## Modify Scalar Data In an Hash of Hashes

The same technique of using coordinates applies both to reading and
modification. If you can "target" an element you can read it or update it.

```ruby
child = {
  :name=>"Carrie Fisher",
  :mother=>{
    :name=>"Debbie Reynolds",
    :mother=>{
      :name=> "Maxene Reynolds"
    },
    :father=>{}
  },
  :father=>{
    :name=>"Eddie Fisher",
    :mother=>{},
    :father=>{}
  }
}

child[:mother][:father] = "Raymond Reynolds"
child #=> {:name=>"Carrie Fisher", :mother=>{:name=>"Debbie Reynolds", :mother=>{:name=>"Maxene Reynolds"}, :father=>"Raymond Reynolds"}, :father=>{:name=>"Eddie Fisher", :mother=>{}, :father=>{}}}
child[:mother][:father] #=> "Raymond Reynolds"
```

You can also replace inner `Hash`es with new `Hash`es:

```ruby
child = {
  :name=>"Carrie Fisher",
  :mother=>{
    :name=>"Debbie Reynolds",
    :mother=>{
      :name=> "Maxene Reynolds"
    },
    :father=>{
      :name=> "Raymond Reynolds"
    }
  },
  :father=>{
    :name=>"Eddie Fisher",
    :mother=>{},
    :father=>{}
  }
}

child[:father][:mother] = {name: "Gitte Winokur", mother: {}, father: {}}
child #=> {:name=>"Carrie Fisher", :mother=>{:name=>"Debbie Reynolds", :mother=>{:name=>"Maxene Reynolds"}, :father=>{:name=>"Raymond Reynolds"}}, :father=>{:name=>"Eddie Fisher", :mother=>{:name=>"Gitte Winokur", :mother=>{}, :father=>{}}, :father=>{}}}
child[:father][:mother] #=> {name: "Gitte Winokur", mother: {}, father: {}}
```

While AoAs or AoHs are frequently described using ONLY literal syntax, with a
HoH, it might be more readable to define the nodes in single-instance variables
and then use the short variables to build the HoH.

## HoH in the Wild

As a closing point, it's not a ***rule*** that all "nodes" in a HoH are all the
same. It's often true, but sometimes not. In the lab, we're going to provide
a simple HoH which breaks the _tendency_ of all nodes to be alike.

## Instructions

For this lab, your task is to build a nested HoH of the classification of
biological life on Earth based on these commented-out snippets assigned to
PORTION_1-PORTION_4. Return that HoH as the return value for the method
"naming_system."

Take a look at `lib/hoh.rb` to get started. The tests will guide your
construction.

## Conclusion

Congratulations, you've learned to use your third nested data structure: the
`Hash` of `Hash`es. You've seen that you can build them by building `Hash`es
filled with variables that point to `Hash`es in an infinite regress. You'll
start off using HoH very rarely, but, in time, thanks to our networked and
social age, you're going to become friends with them.
